# Recipes Website
This recipe website enables to find recipes by ingredients, easing the process of cooking as there won't be any menu to plan.

## Features
There are different information that you can find on the website

### Search Bar
You can search recipes by typing in an ingredient that you want to cook with and an ingredient that you don't want to prepare.
That narrows down the recipes to show you the ones you can cook.
Only 9 recipes are shown at a time to not make the user wander around in a never ending quest for the perfect recipe.
The aim is to have a fast research system to help the users.

### Nutritional Information
Below each recipe, there is an information about the energy provided by the meal. It helps people to know more about the food.

### Recipe Button
The Recipe button enables the users to go to the website page where the recipe is explained step by step.

### The ingredients
We have showed the ingredients of the recipe to help the users in their decision-making process. They will be able to identify the recipes they can actually cook.

## Installation
To use our website you will have to install the files from Git :  https://github.com/Noelle15/dutapp_javascript.git

## Coding languages
We coded the website in HTML and Javascript. We used an API called Edamam to make the requests and find the information.
We used Bootstrap to make it look better.
